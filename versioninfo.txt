Version 0.18:

-Small errors fixed. Rendering and sorting partially optimized.

-Content:
--Block - Small details changed
--Chunk - Comparisons cleaned. BlockSide moved to World. (Could be a separate class..?)
--ChunkLoader - A small land function that will be overwritten by Ian's code
--World - Most rendering stuff here. Sides are analyzed to decrease the size of the array and speed up render time.
---BlockSide - A simple class for the sides of blocks to render with a sort compared to the player and his point of view. Needs images.
--Runner - Smooth render function. Note: mouse stuff commented until stable
--Player - IsInView(Chunk) designed a bit better

-Problems:
--I think the w faces can still overlap occasionally.
--Need to add sides in sorted position, so a binary search for them will change the speed from O(n^3) to O(n^2).
--Need to remove more sides based on their position relative to the player than is currently happening. Be careful.
