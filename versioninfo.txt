Version 0.1:


-Rendering is better, including a start to w. Chunks are now loaded into rendering queue.

-Content
--Block - getPosition function added.
--Chunk - ArrayList of blocks. This will be a problem. It's a massive fight between memory and computation power. Choose one or the other... Maybe later there will be an option for both. Added render preparation functions.
--ChunkLoader - Now has the temporary blocks hardcoded.
--Player - movement features updated. Checking to see if a chunk is in view (minimal).
--Point4D - Distance and angle functions changed a bit for yaw. Be careful...
--Solid - checkSides added. This function will probably just be part of Block in the future.
--World - Added prepareForRender, which just calls it for all loaded chunks.
--Runner - Main runner. Movement functions. Rendering. Currently, w distance appears as change in alpha.

-Problems
--Alpha and chunkInView functions are minimal, and will not work correctly later.
--Should chunks have an ArrayList or array? (memory vs. computations)
--Two transparent blocks will block out each other entirely sometimes.. huh?
