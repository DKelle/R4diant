Version 0.1732:

-Chunks and rendering for transparency are now correct.

-Content:
--Block - Redesigned for the new chunk layout. CheckSides function complete.
--Chunk - Now a 4D array. Period. Transparency sort now correct.
--ChunkLoader - A small random terrain function.
--Solid - CheckSides is now just part of block.
--World - render preparations are now fairly complete.
--Runner - Movement dampening corrected. Rendering for transparency.

-Problems:
--Overlap of w faces, render only the more opaque of the two
--TimSort fails randomly. I don't even know why this happens.
