Ideas and such. Plans. 
Post here for any development jobs.
Just add your name at the bottom with the job you're planning to do.
If you want, I can assign you jobs, but I don't know your skill level, so...
Ask me for more information...


List of necesities:
Rendering for entities/player
Creation of enemies
Enemy AI
Curved rendering for planets
Implementation of wane (4D rotation)
Texture art
Enemy/player art
Texture file lookup algorithms and a way to take an image from it
Texture rendering for each specific side
Making the sides that are not visible not render
Fixing the algorithm to see if a chunk is in view
Making chunks save and load based on player location
Planet chunk layout (VERY DIFFICULT)
Updates for chunks/blocks
Implementation of the w chunk differences
Fixing the alpha rendering
Think of other ways to save memory/processing power
Weather
Biomes
Land generation
Caves (4D caves!!)
Resource generation in general (Where do certain minerals exist?)
Temperature implementation and phase changes
Gravity
Off-grid blocks
Making the game not crash when refocused
